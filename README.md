# GBFHS Implementation for the n-Puzzle Problem

The repository includes C++ code for running the GBFHS, MMe, and A* algorithms for solving the n-puzzle problem. This is meant for experimentation only and was originally written for a paper dissection in CMU's course 15-780: Graduate Artificial Intelligence.
